Good writing does not happen in a vacuum. By its very nature, it is an act of collaboration, as it involves us intimately with the ideas of others as we work together to create and share knowledge in an attempt to advance our collective understanding of our world. So too this volume is the fruit of collaboration among many members of our writing community at the University of Notre Dame.

*Fresh Writing* is now in its twelfth year of publication. This volume continues a tradition of excellence set in motion by Dr. Connie Mick, who conceived of the project and initiated its publication in the year 2000. Under the guidance of Dr. John Duffy, Frances O’Malley Director of the University Writing Program, the *Fresh Writing* project has helped shape the program of writing instruction at the University of Notre Dame, impacting thousands of writers at the University. We owe the very existence of the *Fresh Writing* project to Dr. Mick and Dr. Duffy, and we extend our warm thanks for their vision and continued support of the project.

Our deepest thanks are due to our contributors for sharing their fine work with our writing community in this venue. We also thank those professors whose students’ work appears in this volume: Dr. Eileen Hunt Botting, Dr. Julie Bruneau, Elizabeth Capdevielle, Dr. Patrick Clauss, Dr. Cornelius Delaney, Dr. Erin DietelMcLaughlin, John Dillon, Dr. Isabel Ferreira, Dr. Romana Huk, Ed Kelly, Nicole MacLaughlin, Dr. Louis MacKenzie, Kate Ravin, Dr. Daniel Smith, Kasey Swanke, and Dr. Joseph Teller. Thanks are also due to all those who submitted essays for consideration for publication and their professors for guiding them in work that is truly first-rate.

Our Editorial Board is charged with the very difficult task of choosing a select few essays for publication from among a large number of excellent submissions. For their care and diligence in closely reading each submission, we thank Dr. Julie Bruneau, Elizabeth Capdevielle, Ellen Carroll, Maddie Chandler, Dr. Patrick Clauss, Dr. Erin Dietel-McLaughlin, John Dillon, Josephine Dru, Carolyn Garcia, Marielle Hampe, Kristina Jipson, Semyon Khokhlov, Nicole MacLaughlin, Robin Murphy, Anna Noice, Meagan Simpson, Ryan Sullivan, Anna Sundbo, and Elizabeth Van Jacob.

We thank Terri O’Bryan, Administrative Assistant in the University Writing Program, for her unfailing support—material and emotional—throughout this and all other projects on which we’ve had the good fortune to collaborate.

I offer my personal thanks to Lisa Wess, Senior Managing Editor at Hayden-McNeil, for her patient guidance throughout the *Fresh Writing* project.

Finally, my deepest thanks go to our Assistant Editor Monika Grzesiak for her work on this volume. It has been a great pleasure to collaborate with her on this project, and I am grateful for the chance to learn with her while working to prepare this volume of truly excellent writing.
