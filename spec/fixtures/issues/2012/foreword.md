## Foreword

From the Assistant Editor—

You are holding in your hands a book of some of the strongest essays produced in first-year writing courses of the last academic year. If you are a current first-year student who picked this book up from the bookstore for your own Writing and Rhetoric course, you likely see it as a book of well-written essays that should serve as models for your writing this year. This book is that, a means of showing you what past first-year students have accomplished, but I’d like to offer that it is more than that.

In the course of the school year in which this book was written, two prominent members of the Notre Dame community—University President Rev. John Jenkins and Professor John Duffy, Frances O’Malley Director of the University Writing Program—addressed in public forums the need for intelligent, respectful dialogue in an increasingly polarized country.

In a commencement address to the Wesley Theological Seminary in May, Rev. John Jenkins said, “We in this country are in the midst of a social crisis, a harsh and deepening split between groups that are all too ready to see evil in each other... Both sides call for change, but each believes it’s the other side that must change.” As he told the graduates, “If we are committed to reducing hatred in the world, then the way we engage one another in public debate is not a means to an end; the means are the ends.” In an article for the Chronicle of Higher Education titled “Virtuous Arguments,” Professor John Duffy wrote of the way in which first-year writing courses could be the place where the tools for higher-level public debate are learned: “Indeed, the first-year writing course is the closest thing we have in American public life to a National Academy of Reasoned Rhetoric, a venue in which students can rehearse the virtues of argument so conspicuously lacking in our current political debates. Should students bring these virtues to the civic square, they will inevitably transform it... moving us toward healthier, more productive, and more generous forms of public argument.”

When you are a freshman in college, academic writing doesn’t always feel like a valuable exercise in public discourse. Hearing words like “rhetorical analysis,” “causal argument,” or “research paper” may not bring to mind the idea of improving dialogue in the public sphere. What those words do suggest is a great deal of work— the work of researching, writing, peer reviewing, and rewriting.

And yet, as Professor Duffy articulates, it is in that very practice that you learn the skills of critical analysis so necessary to being an educated and discerning member of a democratic society. What you learn in taking Writing and Rhetoric is that writing is fundamentally about communication, a communication that begins by being conscious of your reader. It means writing with your reader in mind, appealing to his or her intelligence by basing your claims on logic and credible sources, and addressing the concerns of the opposing side in a generous way. You may even find that writing itself can help you to learn, that the act of putting thoughts on the page can bring you to see connections you didn’t see before and to understand your own subject better.

In this twelfth edition of Fresh Writing, students have written on topics ranging from Catholicism in the political sphere to the effects of social media to their own experience working on a tobacco farm or in a local pizza shop. Reading pieces like Patrick Calderon’s “The Church and its Dissenters,” you will see that you can criticize a position with which you agree for the way in which the argument is made, that when it comes to persuading an audience, the means can be just as important as the message.

Reading Collin Ebert’s “Isqat Al-Nizam: Social Media in the Egyptian Revolution” will show you that just because something is written in a headline, even many headlines, does not mean that it is true, and that being an educated member of society means being willing to look beyond the things that are said and to seek knowledge for yourself.

In Timothy Kirchoff’s “A House Divided,” you will see that careful analysis can bring to light the commonalities of seemingly irreconcilable groups, and in Scott Ramey’s “Curing America: An Evaluation of the FDA Drug Approval Policy,” that the best solutions often come from considering the interests of all sides.

To those featured in this book: Bravo. Your being selected for this book means that you have learned early on in your careers the tools of critical analysis and the conventions of academic writing. The skills you have gained will help you to both participate in scholarly conversations and to raise the level of discussion in the Observer viewpoint wars of your next three years.

And to those currently enrolled in Writing and Rhetoric: try to remember—in between drafts and late nights sessions with Purdue OWL as you look up for the fifth time how to cite a web page—that even if it doesn’t feel like it at the time, what you
are learning can help you to become a more discerning and thoughtful participant in a democratic society. Being able to stake a claim in something you care about, find the best arguments to support your position, and persuade your audience while keeping the perspective of your best opponent in mind are skills which have great value beyond an “A” in Writing and Rhetoric; being able to do these things brings the promise of a richer intellectual life for you and a more informed and thoughtful level of discussion on issues of public concern in this country.
