## Acknowledgements
----------
Developing as a writer is a complex project. It doesn’t take place in a single course or over a single semester. It is a continual process that spans one’s life. Indeed, we never truly stop growing as writers. We can always learn more. The best learning takes place in close collaboration with other writers, amid a community of careful and thoughtful readers—professors, Writing Center tutors, and fellow students. Fresh Writing plays a key role in that process of development for many writers at the University of Notre Dame, providing a record of some of our community’s best work. And just as our development as writers depends upon our collaboration with other writers, so too this volume is the fruit of collaboration among several members of our writing community. Many people deserve thanks for making this volume possible.

This edition of *Fresh Writing* marks the eleventh year of publication for a series originally conceived by Dr. Connie Snyder Mick. The *Fresh Writing* project has flourished as a key component of the University Writing Program curriculum, which under the direction of Dr. John Duffy, Francis O’Malley Director of the University Writing Program, has fostered the development of hundreds of Notre Dame writers. We thank both Dr. Mick and Dr. Duffy for their vision in creating a venue for sharing good writing with the community of writers at Notre Dame.

Deepest thanks go to our contributors and to their nominating professors. In particular, we thank those professors whose students’ writing appears in this volume: Dr. Ruth Abbey, Dr. Tobias Boes, Dr. Eileen Hunt Botting, Dr. C.F. Delaney, Dr. Erin Dietel-McLaughlin, John Dillon, Dr. Stephen Fredman, Emily Gandolfi, Ed Kelly, Iris Law, Dr. Blake Leyerle, Dr. Charles Rosenberg, Brian Smith, Lauren Spieller, and Todd Thorpe. Thanks also are due to all who submitted their excellent work for consideration for publication and to their professors for guiding their writing in composition classes and University Seminars.

Our editorial board is faced with the difficult task of choosing a small number of first-rate essays from a large collection of high-quality submissions. For their careful reading and hard work, special thanks goes to this year’s editorial board members: Serina Bellamy, Laura K. Berlage, Richard C. Bevington III, Elizabeth Capdevielle, Dr. Patrick Clauss, Leah Coming, Dr. Erin Dietel-McLaughlin, John Dillon, Kelly Hagen, Henry Hodes, Kristina Jipson, Nicole MacLaughlin, Nathaniel Myers, Anna Sundbo, and Elizabeth Van Jacob.

Terri O’Bryan, Administrative Assistant in the University Writing Program, deserves thanks for all her work to support the *Fresh Writing* project. Indeed, many interesting and exciting ideas hatched by Writing Program faculty and administrators would never get off the ground without her guidance.

I’d also like to thank Lisa Wess, senior managing editor at Hayden-McNeil, for her advice and assistance in this project.

And finally, I’d like to thank our Assistant Editor Betsy Cornwell for her tireless, careful, and cheerful work on Fresh Writing. Without her assistance, this edition would not have been possible.

Enjoy your reading.
