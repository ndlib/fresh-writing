> “There is a kind of writer’s magic.”
> <cite>Dorothea Brande, *Becoming a Writer*</cite>

Too often, when I tell new acquaintances about my studies in the prose MFA pro- gram or my tutoring work in the Writing Center, they respond, “Oh, I could never do that.” People tend to imagine good writing as either innate or divinely inspired, an alchemy understood by only a select few—a sort of magic, as Dorothea Brande has it.

Yet this is magic that can be taught. Brande herself acknowledges as much; in fact, the taught magic of writing is the basis of her classic manual *Becoming a Writer*. Learning to write well means engaging oneself, honestly and ethically, in a constant process of changing and becoming. It means attempting to understand and overcome one’s own limitations, remaining open-minded and thoughtful, and seeking out and communicating with a genuine *other*. This may seem like alchemy, but it is both a normal and a vital process, and one that occurs here on campus every day.

This year’s Fresh Writers are our sorcerers’ apprentices. They are fully engaged
in the process of learning magic, and they have already begun to succeed. Chris Dillon invokes remarkable imagery and detail in “Mepps Aglia #1,” a narrative es- say about fishing with his father. Dan McMurtrie thoroughly analyzes the pros and cons of Lady Gaga’s involvement in the gay rights movement in “Bad Romance.” Natalie Boll reads deep layers of meaning into a seascape painting in “A Marine Paradox,” one of this year’s Snite Museum contest winners. From these few exam- ples, I hope you can see some of the breadth of subject and style that this volume contains. Like any kind of magic, good writing takes many forms, and it is always transformative.

However, these essays have much in common, too, even beyond their clear structures, vivid language, and compelling arguments. They share authorship by students who have come to understand that good writing is a craft, a practice, a learnable skill. They have honed that skill in first year composition, in seminars and electives, and by entering essay contests. They have approached their work with the discipline, honor and steady work ethic that, as I have learned this year, so define student life at Notre Dame.

So if, as you read these wonderful essays, you find yourself thinking “Oh, I could never do that!”—well, you’re wrong. Good writing is absolutely magic, but it’s the magic of hard work and passion, open-mindedness and patience and discovery. This is magic anyone can learn.

I hope these students will inspire you to improve your own writing, whether in academia, journalism, or something as simple as a private journal or as daringly creative as National Novel Writing Month. Come see us at the Writing Center, too—I see small magics performed there every day.

There is proof of magic in this volume. I’m so glad you are discovering it with us.
