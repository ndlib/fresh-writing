In “The Consequences of Human Genetic Engineering,” Kevin Bednar explores the increasingly significant issue of genetic engineering in humans through the biological perspective as opposed to the moral perspective. Inspired by his inher- ent interest in the topic, Kevin asserts that widespread genetic engineering should be cautioned against because of its potentially harmful effects on human health, evolution, and society. Originally from Essex, Vermont, Kevin is a chemical engi- neering major now living in Sorin College. He is still in desperate search of a career plan, but is attempting to enjoy that time of freedom while it lasts.
